# Halo mass:

Watkins et al. (2010; http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010MNRAS.406..264W)
Based on satellite kinematics.
M(<300kpc) = 2.7 +/- 0.5 x 10^12Msun

Boylan-Kolchin et al. (2013; http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...768..140B).
Based on Leo I proper motion.
M_vir = 1.6 +0.8 -0.6 x 10^12 Msun (90% confidence interval; virial overdensity based on Bryan & Norman)
