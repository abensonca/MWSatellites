# Ram pressure stripping simulations

Stephanie is still working on getting the dwarf galaxy ram pressure stripping simulations running. Once they are, she will need suitable orbital parameters to run, and some model for the gas density at the starting radius (i.e. far from the halo). The paper by Diemer & Kravtsov:

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...789....1D

has a fitting formula for the density profile around halos out to ~10 virial radius - this might be useful for setting the initial conditions.

Mike suggested that we may just want to explore a few extremes of orbital parameters initially. This could be done by using the distributions of orbital parameters from e.g.:

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1409.1179J

from which angular momenta and energies can be computed. Andrew B. has these distributions coded up, so could generate a sample of (J,E) pairs from which we could pick some representative values.

Andrew W. is currently working on a separate project to understanding the orbital histories of satellites of the MW, and has the analysis pipeline to take the observed coordinates of satellites, match to satellites in the ELVIS suite, and then back out (probabilistically) orbital histories on a satellite-by-satellite basis. Might be useful if we ever want orbits for individual satellites.
