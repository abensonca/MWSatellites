The current best isolated dwarf galaxy SFHs can be
found in Skillman et al. 2014:

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...786...44S

Figure 10 and Section 4 are the most relevant.

There are a few other isolated dwarfs with
well-constrained SFHs, e.g., Cole et al. 2014:

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...795...54C

and I am leading a cycle 22 HST program to
get SFHS of two more isolated dwarfs: WLM and PegDIG.

I can provide SFH data for all of these systems on request.
