Updates:

Andrew B. updated briefly on Stephanie's work - there are still problems
setting up stable initial conditions for a disk embedded within a hot
halo. Stephanie has been making progress on this though.

Yu Lu: Initial results of MCMC simulations to find models which
reproduce the satellite stellar mass function for MW satellites have
been run. Two versions were run - one in which the set of trees used was
pre-selected to have LMC-like subhalos, and one in which the set of
trees was not preselected in this way. The model with the LMC-like
subhalos clearly provides a better match to the data (and some
significant offset in the posterior distributions for key parameters
such as those which control SNe feedback). Given this, Andrew
W. suggested that we could include an additional constraint and only
consider trees which have a subhalo which matches (approximately at
least) the rotation curve measurements for the LMC. This would guarantee
that we are considering Milky Way-like systems.
