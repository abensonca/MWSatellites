Meeting notes for 12 December 2014
=================================

Attending:
- Andrew Benson
- Annika Peter
- Stephanie Tonneson
- Yu Lu
- Adi Zolotov
- Mike B-K

Andrew B. has generated catalogs of satellite structural and orbital parameters. Stephanie is going to use these to set up matched
hydro simulations.

Yu showed updated figures of subhalo mass accretion histories in MW-like halos. We were confused about why all of the subhalos
fell into the MW halo late (z<1), but finally convinced ourselves that this made sense (since they are relatively massive
subhalos). Yu also had an animation showing the merging history of one of the MW/LMC/SMC systems to aid in understanding why the
LMC and MW halo's growth tracks each other at early times. It was suggested to expand the range of halos shown (to include those
not present at z=0) and the size of the spatial region shown, and perhaps also plot these up as a merger tree to give more insight
into the growth of the MW halo.
