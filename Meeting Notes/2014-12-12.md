- Yu Lu
- Andrew Wetzel

# Milky Way Satellite Mass Functions

Andrew reported working on getting Milky Way satellite stellar mass
functions from his SAM - should be ready next week.......

Yu showed a plot showing the number of SMCs in his SAM as a function of
MW halo mass - see hostmass.png. There is a clear preference for more
SMCs in higher mass MWs, but there are SMCs present in some of even the
lowest mass halos.

# Ram Pressure Stripping Simulations

Stephanie is going to work on getting Enzo running on our local cluster
next week, then we'll be ready (hopefully) to run some simulations with
realistic orbits.

A file has been added to the repo to collate constraints on Milky Way
halo mass, gas density profile, and satellite orbits. Please add to this
any relevant constraints.
